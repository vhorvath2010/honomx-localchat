# honomx-localchat

A basic RTC app built using Hono and HTMX. The core motivation here is for me to learn HTMX and get some [HATEOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS) experience. Plus messing around with websockets as an added bonus.

## Getting started

1. Install [Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/getting_started/installation/)
2. Install dependencies: `deno install`
3. Start and watch server: `deno run dev`
